## Strings

## Question 1

You are given a string stored in variable `problem`. Write code that prints the longest word in the string.

```swift
var problem = "find the longest word in the problem description"

// Your code here
```

Example:
Input:
`var problem = "find the longest word in the problem description"`

Output:
`description`

Hint: Keep track of the longest word you encounter and also keep track of its length.
