## Strings

## Question 1

You are given a string stored in variable `problem`. Write code that prints the longest word in the string.

```swift
var problem = "find the longest word in the problem description"

// Your code here
```

Example:
Input:
`var problem = "find the longest word in the problem description"`

Output:
`description`

Hint: Keep track of the longest word you encounter and also keep track of its length.


***
## Question 2

Given a string in English, create a tuple containing the number of vowels and consonants.

```swift
let vowels = "aeiou"
let consonants = "bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz"
let input = "Count how many vowels I have!"
```

***
## Question 3

Given a string with multiple words. Reverse the string word by word.

Example:

Sample Input: `"Swift is the best language"`

Sample Output: `"language best the is Swift"`

***


## Question 4

You are given a string representing an **attendance record** for a student. The record only contains the following three characters:

`'A' : Absent.`

`'L' : Late.`

`'P' : Present.`

If a student has more than one 'A' or more than 2 continuous 'L's that student should not be rewarded. Print true if student is to be rewarded and False if they shouldn't.

Example:

Sample Input: `"PPALLP"`

Sample Output: `true`

***
## Question 5

Given a string of words separated by a `" "`. Write code that prints out the length of the last word.

If there is no last word print out `"No last word"`.

Example:
Input: `"How are you doing this Monday?"`

Output: `7`

***

## Question 6

Given an array of Ints, find out if it contains a target number.  

(The built-in `contains(_:)` function will do this, but you aren't allowed to use it for this exercise.)


```swift
var numbers: [Int]

let target: Int = 32
```

Ex.1

```swift
numbers = [4,2,6,73,32,4,2,1]

target = 32

//true
```

Ex. 2

```swift
numbers = [32459,2,4,5,1,4,2,1]

target = 3

//false
```

***

## Question 7

Find the largest value in an array of Int.  Do not use the built-in `max()` method.

```swift
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

//This creates an array of 100 numbers in between 0 and 200.  For now, you don't need to worry about how it does that.
```

***

## Question 8

Append every Int that appears in both `listOne` and `listTwo` to the `sharedElements` array. Then print **how many Ints** are shared.

```swift
var listOne = [28, 64, 7, 96, 13, 32, 94, 11, 80, 68]
var listTwo = [18, 94, 48, 6, 42, 68, 79, 76, 13, 7]
var sharedElements = [Int]()
```

## Question 9

Write code such that `noDupeList` has all the same Ints as `dupeFriendlyList`, but has no more than one of each Int.

```swift
var dupeFriendlyList = [4,2,6,2,2,6,4,9,2,1]
var noDupeList: [Int] = []
```

***

## Question 10

Identify if there are 3 integers that sum to 10 in the following array. If so, print them as a triplet. If there are multiple triplets, print all possible triplets.

`var tripleSumArr = [-20,-14, -8,-5,-3,-2,1,2,3,4,9,15,20,30]`


## Bonus Question

Given an array of Strings, find the the String with the most "a"s in it.

input: `["apes", "abba", "apple"]`

output: `"abba"`
