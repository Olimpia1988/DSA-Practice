## Strings

## Question 1

You are given a string stored in variable `problem`. Write code that prints the longest word in the string.

```swift
var problem = "find the longest word in the problem description"

// Your code here
```

Example:
Input:
`var problem = "find the longest word in the problem description"`

Hint: Keep track of the longest word you encounter and also keep track of its length.

## Question 2

Given a string in English, create a tuple containing the number of vowels and consonants.

```swift
let vowels = "aeiou"
let consonants = "bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz"
let input = "Count how many vowels I have!"
```

***

## Question 4

You are given a string representing an **attendance record** for a student. The record only contains the following three characters:

`'A' : Absent.`

`'L' : Late.`

`'P' : Present.`

If a student has more than one 'A' or more than 2 continuous 'L's that student should not be rewarded. Print true if student is to be rewarded and False if they shouldn't.
